"This riddle is one of twelve translated by Michael G. Gaunt from George Philip Krapp's and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie's version of the Exeter Book.  The Exeter Book (ca 950 AD) contains sections on Anglo-Saxon poetry as well as 95 extant Anglo-Saxon riddles and some Latin riddles.  Keep in mind that in Anglo-Saxon times, alliteration was just as, if not more important than rhyme when it came to riddles and poetry.  You are not expected to be able to solve these riddles, as many of the references are now culturally obsolete.  Rather, I am posting these as a tribute to the history of riddles. 4.Sometimes my servant---------------------------urges me to action. I am wrapped up in rings,--------------------------eagerly attentive. He bids me break my bed,-----------------------and call out clearly.that my sovereign sent me----------a ring to wrap round my neck. Many times a maiden------------------or warrior, when I am weary, gives me a greeting,-------------------------grim-hearted they are; my answer is wintry-cold.-------------------------------A warm limb.sometimes bursts my bonds,-----------the ring wrapped round me. And though he may be in thought,---my crack-brained companion, the peals please him,--------------------------and myself the same.
